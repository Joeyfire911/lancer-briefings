Senatorious Armstrong was born and raised on on Lincoln, a colony on the outskirts of Union space.
Being so far from major legislative centers Lincoln suffered from severe government corruption, to the point that the very ideals the Union was founded on were all to often trampeled by greedy Bureacrats.  This is where Armstrong comes into the picture, he believed that if he could rise through the legislative ranks he would be able to restore the ideals of the Union.
    Unfortunatly, while he was able to be elected to the colony's legislature he found that the corruption had settled to deeply into the government for one man to remove.  Feeling as if his cause was hopeless he withdrew into study, until one day when searching through some old archives came across an (incomplete) codex regarding an ancient nation on cradle, one called The United States of America.  Reading the codices he felt an upwelling of fresh inspiration, inspiring him to take the decision to report the corruption and moral iniquity of Lincolns Government to Union officials on a neighboring colony.  Long story short, Union forces were sent in to help rid the government of corruption, culminating in a 1v1 melee between Armstrong and the corrupt leader of the colony,
with Armstrong and the Union standing victorious.  After the conflict Armstrong vowed that no world would suffer the pain his did, launching his personal crusade against corruption that he continues to this day.
