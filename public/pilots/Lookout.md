Jean-Jacques found employment under a particularly sadistic supervisor within the Defense Authority of his (non-union) home planet. The policing force directed by this supervisor began planting the seeds of unrest by overstepping many established freedoms. That unrest that eventually became a coup. A coup that "Jeac" shed his given name in favor of his new freedom fighter alias. Supervisor O'Doyle, the individual responsible for enforcing the suppression of their own charge, did not see the preparations for the change in their leadership role. This oversight lead them to their eventual death. "Jeac" played a minor role in the grand coup of his home-city, though ultimately was the one responsible for dealing the killing blow to O'Doyle in an assault against a Defense Authority strategy center. Afterwards he claimed the dead and dethroned supervisor's Everest mech as a trophy. He then pledged to get a union license to become stronger and return to the planet to enforce the new regime's freedoms.
