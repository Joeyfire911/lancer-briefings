After finally arriving to the blinkgate it was quickly realized the station was still occupied. These hostiles presented a road block for the team as they entered the cargo bay.

The engineers have been secured. In so doing the party faced a Mirage pattern frame which was carrying out of date digital IDs. These dated back to the Seccomm era of Union. I am looking into the matter further.

Nice work team. The engineers are safe in the maintenance bay. Once youre ready give the signal and we will start the boot sequence. Once we start expect hostile activity to try and stop it. Oh! and Winter thanks you for the cryo pod. The captain is awake and recovering now.
